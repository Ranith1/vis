            <p>This visualization shows the amount of money spent on pokies (slot machines) across different regions in Victoria. The darker the color, the higher the spend in that region.
                Spending evidently gets significantly higher in urban areas, due to higher population density, increased economic activity and more pokies venues. Rural areas have a lower amount of
                money spent, due to lower population density and economic differences.

                Tip: Try zooming into a region or hovering over one!

        <div class="description-box">
            <p>This pie chart compares the number of pokies in Metro vs. Regional areas of Victoria. Each slice represents the proportion of pokies in each area. The majority of pokies are located in metro areas, as indicated by the larger portion of the pie chart being assigned to "Metro." This can be attributed to higher population in metro areas, greater economic concentration, and the fact that metropolitan areas tend to be hubs for tourism and entertainment.
